# C-_Library_Code
My first c++ demo for nuaa c++ program course,it's a simple library demo for brrowing and giving back books!
No charming GUI interface ,just black termminal!

# notice
- Do not submit the orginal code for the course!It will be a disaster if the teacher finds you copy the same codes,so just modify some codes and make something be yours own.
- Looking forward a star for me！Thank you!
